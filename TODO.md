1) Fix the buggy appearance of the halt powerup. Set DIFFICULTY = 0 temporarily?
2) Sometimes after dying, pressing restart leads to another immediate death. Figure out why?
3) Change runner movement and collision detection methods to prevent moving sideways or upwards into obstacles or platforms.
4) Changes to Account Screen:
  - Difficult to read the text on some buttons
  - Log the user in when they click on a table row rather than the "Select Account" button?
  - Change table style at all?
  - "Create New Account" button gives a prompt instead of having JTextbox on screen?
5) Add game physics to make the runner jump feature work better, and maybe increase gravity?
6) Add in a password feature for accounts?
7) JLabel on menu screen displaying the current account, somewhere near the "Change Account" button?
8) Add JLabels to running screen to display powerup durations?
9) Modify obstacle spawn locations? Figure this out by playing the game several times.
10) Add MUSIX
